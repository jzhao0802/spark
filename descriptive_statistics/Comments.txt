There are 2 functions:
1. function "data_ds": it is used to do descriptive analysis, the result include 6 colunms:
	Variable: variables name
	cntNonZero: the amount of non zero values
	Min: the minimum value
	Avg: the average value
	SD:  the variance
	Max: the maximum value
2. function "cross_tb": it is used to do cross table between response and other columns. there are 2 steps:
	step 1: Calculate the amount of distinct values in each columns, for the columns more than 2 levels, we won't calculate the cross table.
	setp 2: Based on the columns selected from step 1. calculate the cross table with response and output the results.
		file 1 - "Cross_Table.csv": this is the cross tables of all selected columns.
		file 2 - "Dropped_variables.csv": this is the columns that should be dropped in the model using the following criterion:
			1). Completed separated the response;
			2). Positive response rate is less than our pre-set value(minrate in the code);
